Day 1 :: 13-05-2020

Started coding bot in python, because I had more experience with python than with java script.
Then I understood that I don't really know discord.py and discord.js (discord API for js and python).
As I had experience coding discord bots in python I knew that discord.py documentation is unreadable and has changed recently...(It would be nightmare to try code bot in python)
Fortunately Datorium introduced me to discord.js and I really liked it, the documentation is simple and easy to understan, huge community and easyer to code here than in python.

I created code to get all mentioned users ID's when someone typed !upvote or !downvote and @mentioned someonte
(At first I was thinking to add option to add specific amount of points, but then I tought it would be not good... So I will create only +1 or -1 point)
Also I have to disable option to upvote or downvote yourself...

Firstly I tried to implement MySql database, and watched some tutorials on web but it was very complicated and I couldn't understand anything...
Then I remembered in python I was using Sqlite not MySql, so I implemented Sqlite3 from node.js and everything worked very well!
